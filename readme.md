# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis: Insights on Lunch, Ethnicity & Parental Education

This project analyzes the **Student Performance Dataset** to uncover insights into how factors such as **gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation** affect student outcomes in **Math, Reading, and Writing** scores.

The analysis is done using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, **SQL**, and **Excel**, with results visualized for easy interpretation.

## 📊 Project Overview

Education plays a crucial role in shaping student success. This project explores key questions:

- Do **parents’ education levels** influence student performance?  
- Does **lunch type** affect scores?  
- Are there differences across **race/ethnicity groups**?  
- How does **test preparation** impact results?  

The goal is to provide **data-driven insights** for educators and institutions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on student performance.  
- Identify **key factors** affecting academic success.  
- Visualize insights with **clear charts and graphs**.  
- Deliver a **comprehensive report** for educational analysis.
